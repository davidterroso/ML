# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning â€“ Math Foundations

This repository is a personal project focused on explaining and implementing the **mathematical foundations** behind key machine learning algorithms. Each notebook walks through the theory step-by-step, along with code implementations and visualizations for deeper understanding.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `classification.ipynb` â€“ Mathematical derivation and implementation of core classification algorithms, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Boundaries
  - Gradient Descent in Classification

- `regression.ipynb` â€“ Detailed explanation and code for:
  - Linear Regression (Normal Equation and Gradient Descent)
  - Cost Functions
  - Model Evaluation

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The goal of this project is to **demystify the math** behind machine learning models by combining formulas, explanations, and Python code in a digestible format â€” ideal for students, enthusiasts, or anyone wanting to strengthen their theoretical grounding.
